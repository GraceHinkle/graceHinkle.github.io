        <p>Heya Folks, my name is Grace Hinkle!</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>In regards to 260 specifically, I'm excited to get better at the actual coding aspect of web-design. Awhile ago I was hired as both a receptionist and the redesigner for the Biomolecular Research Center's (BRC) BSU websites. However, because of BSU's pre-built-in website building systems (Wordpress to be specfic), I've gotten experience redesigning the look of websites, but haven't gotten to handle the code yet. I'm hoping that this course will give me a better understanding the "back-workings" to website design so that when the BRC moves to a different system I'm prepared. </p>
        <p>BSU has a lot of built in limitations to what you can modify with their "formats", so this was originally going to look differently, but if you'd like a look at a website page I remodeled within their parameters and currently manage and update then click the link below.</p>

        <p>As for my futue plans, honestly, no clue!</p>
        <p>I know that sounds bad but trust me it's a lot better than where I was a year ago. I didn't even want to go to college because the only thing I was good at (art) I was extremely burnt-out from and I was unsure on how to approach my future in relation to that. I was signed up last minute for the last orienation day to go through and become a general studies major, but then I found GIMM. I'm really happy I found GIMM because despite being burnt-out from art and knowing I didn't want to pursue a career solely in that, I also knew that I didn't want to completely give it up. Even if I don't know what I want to do, having a major that helps me comfortably learn about different ways I can apply and expand my art skills makes me feel a lot more sure about the future.</p>

        <p>Heres a bucket-list of things I'd like to do/learn before I graduate</p>
