        <h3>Heya Folks, my name is Grace Hinkle!</h3>
        <p>I am a sophomore at Boise State University in the Gaming Interactive Media Mobile major. I work at the Boise State Biomolecular Research Institute as a Clerical Assistant and website designer.
          I have a lot of experience working with both physical and digital art, and am currently learning more about website design and videogame creation. 
          This portfolio will show you some of my best most recent work.
