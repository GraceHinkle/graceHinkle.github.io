        <p id="about_me">Through school I've grown to better understand the basics of game building through Unity. I have made both 3D and 2D functioning games, but my best work is in my 2D material.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>The Dragons Keep</h3>
        <br>
          <h5>Background:</h5>
           <p>The Dragons Keep is a 2D platformer game I built in my first semester of college, and have been growing bit by bit the more I learn. The premise right now is that you play as a humanoid creature who has been sent on a quest by your ruler to track down the dragon who stole all of the royal jewels and collect any lost gems along the way. The game so far includes two completed levels with which all the coding and asset designs I created myself. When I first made The Dragons Keep, there was a big focus on the art aspects, from environment and sprite designing, to the animations and even making background music for the levels.
           The better I get at game creation and coding, the more I plan to improve the game. I have a made plans to expand and fleshout the story, and have already begun working on a following levels beyond just the two. </p>
          <h5>Gameplay:</h5>
           <p>Move around by using the WASD Keys and jump to collect coins by pressing the spacebar. Dodge obstacles and moving enemies, ride moving platforms across parts of the levels, and try to make it to the horned statues that light up and save your progress. You will need a certain number of a certain type of gem to give to the Gatekeeper, the snake statues, to proceed to the next level.</p>

        <p id="about_me">Despite my best work being in 2D, I have also learned how to make functional 3D minigames in unity.</p>

                     <div class='col-md-6'><h4>Countdown Leapfrog</h4>A multiplayer minigame where you play against a friend on the same keyboard to see who can gain the most points in 60 seconds. You are put into a big arena with obstacles and pillars to jump on, to win you must collect 10 points before the other player does and the timer runs out. You can collect points by picking up any of the limited number of coins the other player has't taken yet, or by jumping over the other player fully without interference. If either of you win the game will end with "You Won!", and if the time runs out before either of you can hit 10 points, you both lose. to add an extra layer of challenge, you can't see the timer once the game is in play. </div>
                     <div class='col-md-6'><h4>Shooter</h4>This is a shooter game prototype where you move around a little maze like arena and need to dodge the fireballs the wandering enemy will shoot at you if they see you. You can kill the enemy by aiming your crosshair and right clicking. However, not only will the enemy respawn, but they change color and shape everytime. Sometimes they will be a big, bright and easy target, and other times they will be small, hidden and hard to shoot. There is currently no way to win the game and it has a lot of little bugs, but the main movement and shooting mechanics work.</div>
