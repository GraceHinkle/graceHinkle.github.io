        <h4> Both through school and work I have become more familar and experienced at working with and creating new websites. My work includes having the update and manage the main websites my office heads within wordpress, and map any new additions. Recently the department rebranded so I was given the task of mapping and adjusting everything accordingly from titles to urls and making sure it all complied to BSU's website rules.
            Through my major I have learned how to create new websites and get them presentable using html, css and javascript, and how to run them on a server. I am currently learning how to make websites cooperate with databases and allow information to be collected on the backend.
